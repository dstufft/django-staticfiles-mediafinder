With Django 1.3, django-staticfiles is now a contrib application. With the move into contrib,
a few changes were made, one of those changes was to rename the media sub directory an app
could define, to static. This app is a finder that allows you to continue using the old 
media directory. It is designed to be a temporary use app, until third party applications
that were using the old media directory, switch to the new static directory.
